# SUNSHINE

The weather can change in a split second. Your safety depends on timely nowcasts and forecasts that provide understandable information you can use. While we once relied on radio and television for updated information, today, the Sun Shine replace it.

In this project I created a weather app, which uses an API from openweathermap to get weather information all over the world . You can enter your location to get weather data . You can also use search to find the current weather at a city, for example London or Paris. The app displays local temperature, gives you a brief description and also shows an icon based on the weather and it also change background according to the location .
